Instructions for running the program:

1- Make a new Java project in your IDE.
2- Unzip the file and then put the Assignment2 package inside the src folder of your IDE. (That is, in the src, there should be three folders called resources, response, and server).
3- Run your IDE and then go to the "Server" class in the subpackage "server" and run the main method on the class.

Notice1: Two arguments must be entered (in the edit configurations). The first one is the port and the second part is the path (C:\Users\nimas\Documents\LastREVNETwork\src\resources\inner).

Note2: The program is written in Java language, so it is needed to have an IDE that can run Java files installed on your computer.
Notice3: The default port is 8080.

Notice4: When the server has been run in the IDE, by using the following URL in the browser, the client will be connected.

http://localhost:8080/
